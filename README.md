I'm a GCSE student trying to get better at coding with python.
It's not going too well right now (12/02/24), but now I have started to get out of tutorial hell.
In the process of doing cs50 programming with python and getting better at LeetCode.
Have gotten iDea and sololearn awards but they don't really mean much.
I have done the PCEP from NetAcad.
- Completed CS50 Python 01/05/24
